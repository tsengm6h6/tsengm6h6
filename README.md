Hello there ðŸ‘‹,

I'm a self-taught web developer. </br>
With curiosity as my motivation, I have a passion for learning new skills aim to create useful and lovely websites.

One of my favorite parts in my previous 3-year experiences in customer support is to help people solve problems. The ability benefits me for communicating and collaborating with diverse teams.

When I'm not working, you might find me scuba diving :diving_mask: in the ocean around islands of Taiwan. :desert_island: </br>
I'm a fan of different cultures and beautiful nature who used to travel a lot.
Now that traveling is not a good idea because of covid-19, why not dive into the ocean and enjoy the amazing marine life? :call_me_hand::call_me_hand::call_me_hand:
